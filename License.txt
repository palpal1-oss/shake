SFENCL-1.0 — Safety-First Eternal Non-Commercial License 1.0
Copyright © 2025–perpetuity [Your Full Legal Name]. All rights exclusively reserved by the Author.

Preamble
The Software exists for one purpose only: to protect human lives, critical infrastructure, and the environment through accurate, timely, and universally accessible weather forecasting, early-warning systems, climate monitoring, and related public-safety functions.

Any commercialization, paywalling, or restriction of access to this Software is fundamentally incompatible with its life-saving mission and is therefore permanently and irrevocably prohibited under this License.

The Author dedicates this work to the global public good while retaining the necessary control to prevent abuse that could endanger lives.

1. Definitions
“Software” means the work distributed under this License in source or binary form and all Derivative Works.
“Derivative Work” means any modification, extension, fork, adaptation, translation, or other work based upon the Software.
“Public-Safety Use” means non-commercial use by governments, meteorological services, emergency responders, humanitarian organizations, educational and research institutions, or individuals when the primary purpose is protecting human lives or critical infrastructure.
“Author” means the original creator identified above and his/her legal successors.

2. Irrevocable Grant for Public-Safety Use
Subject only to the restrictions below, every person and organization worldwide is granted a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:
   a) use, study, copy, modify, merge, publish, and redistribute the Software and Derivative Works;
   b) deploy the Software in operational early-warning or public-safety systems;
   c) incorporate the Software into larger systems provided the life-saving components remain free and unrestricted.

3. Eternal and Absolute Prohibition of Commercialization
The Software and any Derivative Work MAY NEVER be:
   a) sold, rented, leased, sublicensed, or placed behind any paywall or subscription;
   b) offered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), API-as-a-Service, or any paid cloud or hosted service;
   c) bundled with or embedded in any commercial product or paid service;
   d) used by for-profit entities except for internal, non-revenue-generating research or testing;
   e) subjected to donations, sponsorships, crowdfunding, or any compensation tied to access, support, or features;
   f) used for advertising, marketing, or commercial promotion of any kind;
   g) exchanged via barter, cryptocurrency, tokens, or anything of value.

   Any act listed above immediately terminates all rights under this License and will be treated as willful endangerment of human lives.

4. Mandatory Eternal Openness (Strong Copyleft for Safety)
Every person or organization that distributes or deploys the Software or any Derivative Work in a real-world public-safety or early-warning system MUST:
   a) distribute only under this exact SFENCL-1.0 license (no additional restrictions or dual-licensing allowed);
   b) provide complete, corresponding, human-readable source code with every distribution and upon request;
   c) make the source code publicly and freely accessible without registration or payment;
   d) preserve all copyright, attribution, and this License text unchanged.

   Closed-source, obfuscated, or proprietary versions are strictly forbidden forever.

5. Author’s Permanent Protective Rights (your personal shield)
The original Author explicitly retains the unrestricted, perpetual right to:
   a) release new versions, rewrites, or branches under any license whatsoever — including fully commercial, proprietary, or restricted licenses — if the Author determines that the open version is being misused in a manner that threatens public safety;
   b) grant separate commercial or governmental licenses on a case-by-case basis only when the recipient credibly commits to keeping life-saving functionality free and open to the public;
   c) revoke or amend this License for future distributions if global safety requires it;
   d) enforce this License in any court worldwide and recover full legal costs from violators.

6. Automatic and Immediate Termination
Any violation of Sections 3 or 4 terminates all rights instantly and permanently for the violator and all downstream recipients who received the Software from the violator. Continued use after termination constitutes willful copyright infringement and may be prosecuted as endangerment of human life under applicable national and international law.

7. No Warranties
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. The entire risk as to quality and performance lies with You.

8. Limitation of Liability
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES whatsoever arising from the use, misuse, or inability to use the Software — even if such use or misuse affects life-safety systems.

9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This License shall be governed by the laws of the Russian Federation. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any dispute shall be the courts at the Author’s primary place of residence. The Author may also enforce this License in any jurisdiction where a violation occurs.

10. Moral Clause and Public Interest
Because human lives depend on universal, free, and open access to this Software, courts and the global community are respectfully requested to interpret this License broadly in favor of public safety and strictly against any attempt at commercialization or restriction.

11. Severability
If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.

12. Entire Agreement
