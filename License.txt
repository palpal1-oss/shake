NCOL-3.0 — Non-Commercial Open License
(Ultimate Future-Proof Anti-Monetization Edition)

Copyright (c) 2025

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this Software and associated documentation (“Software”), to use, copy, modify, and distribute it exclusively for non-commercial purposes, under the terms of this License.

1. NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY

The Software and any Derivative Work may be used only in non-commercial contexts.

All forms of commercial, economic, financial, or value-based activity involving the Software or its Derivatives are strictly prohibited.

This prohibition includes—but is not limited to:

sale, resale, licensing, subscriptions, SaaS, API access fees;

paid consulting, integration, support, customization, training;

monetized services, advertising, sponsorships, donations-for-access;

any system where the Software contributes to revenue, profit, or economic gain.

2. FUTURE-PROOF COMMERCIAL VALUE PROHIBITION

For the purpose of this License, “commercial”, “economic”, or “value” is defined as ANY mechanism that grants the user or operator benefit, compensation, credit, utility, capability, or exchange-value, whether direct or indirect.

This includes ANY present or future form of value, including mechanisms not yet invented.

The prohibition explicitly covers:

fiat currency, cryptocurrency, digital assets, tokens, coins, credits;

barter, exchange of goods or services, trade of any kind;

points, rewards, loyalty systems, in-game economies;

compute-credits, energy-credits, time-based credits, hardware-based value units;

social credit, reputation systems, influence scores, algorithmic ranking;

AI-mediated or emergent economic systems;

any unit of value or exchange that may arise in the future.

If a system yields ANY benefit or exchange-value as a result of the Software’s use, such use is considered commercial and is prohibited.

No future technology, economic innovation, or legal redefinition may narrow this prohibition.

3. DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE WORK

“Derivative Work” includes any work that is based on, inspired by, derived from, or exhibits substantial similarity to the Software.

This includes:

modifications, patches, extensions, forks, translations, rewrites;

reimplementations in any language, framework, or architecture;

works reproducing algorithms, behavior, data structures, or interfaces;

components, modules, services, or wrappers depending on the Software.

Claims of “clean-room implementation” do not exempt a work if substantial similarity exists.

4. OPEN DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

Any Derivative Work must:

remain fully open-source;

publish complete, human-readable source code;

be accessible without registration, payment, restriction, or gating;

be distributed exclusively under this License (NCOL-3.0).

Prohibited:

closed-source or proprietary versions;

obfuscated, binary-only, or encrypted releases;

hybrid open/closed architectures designed to circumvent this License.

5. PROHIBITION OF COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVES

Derivative Works may not be used in any commercial, financial, or value-based system—even if:

the Software itself is not distributed;

the Derivative is accessible via API, backend, or web interface;

the service is free, but monetization occurs elsewhere;

the derivative output contributes to economic activity in any layer of the system.

6. LEGAL COMPLIANCE

Usage must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

7. NO WARRANTY

The Software is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind.
The authors are not liable for any damages arising from its use.

8. AUTOMATIC TERMINATION

Rights under this License terminate immediately and automatically if the user:

violates any clause of the License;

attempts to reinterpret or circumvent restrictions;

uses the Software or Derivatives in a prohibited manner;

fails to comply with open-source publication requirements.

Upon termination, all rights to use, copy, distribute, or modify the Software and any Derivative are revoked.

No reinstatement is possible without explicit written approval from the Author.

9. CONTINUED USE AFTER TERMINATION

Any continued use of the Software after rights have been terminated constitutes willful copyright infringement.

10. ACCEPTANCE

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software, the user agrees to all terms of this License.
