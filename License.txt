**NCOL-2.0 — Non-Commercial Open License

(Enhanced Derivative Protection)**
Copyright (c) 2025

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (“Software”), to use,
copy, modify, and distribute it solely under the terms outlined below.

1. NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY

The Software and any Derivative Work (as defined in Section 2) may be used
exclusively for non-commercial purposes.

Commercial use is strictly prohibited, including but not limited to:

sale, resale, licensing, SaaS, subscriptions, API access fees;

paid consulting, integration, customization, training, analysis;

indirect monetization, donations for access, sponsorship-for-use;

any economic activity in which the Software or its Derivatives
provide core functionality, value, computation, processing,
or enable revenue in any form.

2. DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE WORK (EXTENDED)

For the purposes of this License, “Derivative Work” includes, but is not limited to:

modifications, forks, translations, ports, re-expressions, or adaptations;

rewrites or reimplementations in another language, framework, paradigm, or architecture;

any work exhibiting substantial similarity in functionality, structure,
algorithms, data models, behavior, or interface;

components, wrappers, modules, layers, or services that depend on the Software
for essential or core functionality;

API wrappers, service layers, or backend systems built around the Software.

A claim of “clean-room implementation” does not exempt a work from being
considered a Derivative if substantial similarity is present.

3. OPEN DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT

Any Derivative Work must:

remain fully open-source;

provide complete, human-readable source code;

be publicly accessible without paywalls, registration, or restrictions;

be distributed solely under this same License (NCOL-2.0), without alteration.

The following are strictly prohibited:

closed-source, proprietary, binary-only, encrypted, or obfuscated releases;

splitting functionality into open and closed components to circumvent this License;

bundling with proprietary components that depend on or integrate with the Software.

4. PROHIBITION OF COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVES

The creation, distribution, deployment, or use of Derivative Works
in any commercial or revenue-generating context is prohibited.

This prohibition applies even if:

the Software itself is not distributed;

the Derivative is provided through a web interface, API, backend,
or integrated service;

access to the Software or Derivative is free,
but monetization occurs elsewhere in the system.

5. LEGAL COMPLIANCE

The Software may not be used in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.

6. NO WARRANTY AND LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages arising from the use
of the Software or any Derivative Work.

7. ACCEPTANCE OF LICENSE

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software, the user agrees
to be bound by all terms of this License.

8. AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF RIGHTS

Any permission granted by this License automatically and immediately terminates,
without notice, if the user:

violates any clause of this License;

attempts to circumvent, reinterpret, or partially comply with terms
in a way that contradicts the intent of this License;

distributes or operates the Software or a Derivative in a prohibited manner;

fails to meet open-source publication requirements;

engages in any form of commercial activity involving the Software
or any Derivative Work.

8.1. Loss of All Rights

Upon termination, the user loses all rights to:

use, run, execute, or deploy the Software;

copy, distribute, publish, or host the Software;

create, modify, or distribute Derivative Works;

integrate or utilize the Software or its Derivatives in any system or service.

All further use becomes unauthorized and unlawful under applicable copyright law.

8.2. No Reinstatement

Termination is automatic, requires no warning,
and rights cannot be restored by later attempts at compliance.

Only the original author may explicitly grant renewed permission in writing.
Silence or lack of response does not constitute consent.

8.3. Continuing Use After Termination

Any continued use after termination constitutes willful copyright infringement
and may be subject to legal enforcement, takedown actions, and claims for damages.
