NCOL-2.0 — Non-Commercial Open License (Enhanced Derivative Protection)
Copyright (c) 2025

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to use,
copy, modify, and distribute it solely under the following conditions:

1. NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY

The Software and any Derivative Work (as defined below) may be used exclusively for non-commercial purposes.

Commercial use is strictly prohibited, including but not limited to:

sale, resale, licensing, SaaS, subscriptions, API access fees;

paid consulting, integration, customization, training, analysis;

indirect monetization, donations for access, sponsorship-for-use;

any economic activity where the Software or its Derivatives provide
essential functionality, computation, or value.

2. DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE WORK (EXTENDED)

For the purposes of this License, “Derivative Work” includes, but is not limited to:

modifications, forks, translations, ports, or adaptations;

reimplementations, rewrites, or re-expressions in another language,
framework, paradigm, or architecture;

any work exhibiting substantial similarity in:

functionality,

structure,

algorithms,

data models,

behavior or interface;

components, wrappers, modules, or services that depend on the Software
for core functionality, including API wrappers and service layers.

A claim of “clean-room implementation” does not exempt a work from being
considered a Derivative if substantial similarity is present.

3. OPEN DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT

Any Derivative Work must:

remain fully open-source;

include complete readable source code;

be publicly accessible without paywalls, registration, or access restrictions;

be distributed solely under this same License (NCOL-2.0), without alteration.

No part of the Software or any Derivative Work may be:

closed-source, proprietary, binary-only, encrypted, or obfuscated;

split into open and closed components to circumvent this clause;

bundled with proprietary components that rely on or integrate with the Software.

4. PROHIBITION OF COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVES

The creation, distribution, or use of Derivative Works in any commercial
or revenue-generating context is prohibited.

This includes commercial products or services which:

rely on the Software for computation, logic, or data processing;

provide access to the Software through an API, web interface, backend, or service;

incorporate or depend on the Software even if the Software itself is not distributed.

5. LEGAL COMPLIANCE

The Software may not be used in violation of applicable law.

6. NO WARRANTY AND LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind.
In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages arising from use.
