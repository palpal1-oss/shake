🔴 CRITICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN shake.py AND deep-shake.py
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ shake.py — Short-Term Surface Stress Model (0–30 days ahead)
--------------------------------------------------------------
• Shows activation zones that appear **60–100 days before real events**
• Tracks **crustal stress**, **energy halos**, **plasticity**, and **migration**
• Produces short-term windows with an **uncontrolled uncertainty of 0–72 hours**

➤ Interpretation:
A hotspot for “tomorrow” may occur *any time from now to +72 hours*.

This is normal and expected because surface activation depends on
brittle-failure timing, not deterministic schedule.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔵 deep-shake.py — Deep-Structure + Super-Event Candidate Model
---------------------------------------------------------------
This model requires the **full available earthquake catalog**, including:

• microquakes 1.0–2.0  
• moderate events  
• major events 6–8+  
• full long-window sequences (60–180+ days recommended)

deep-shake.py reconstructs **deep, slow energy structures** and identifies:

• long-term high-magnitude candidates  
• M8+ / M9– class “super-event” precursors  
• multi-exit fault systems (same candidate → multiple possible surface points)  
• decade-scale mantle-driven anomalies, not short-term prediction  

🟦 IMPORTANT:
deep-shake.py does **NOT** predict exact dates.  
It shows *structural inevitability*, not timing.

★★★ The deeper the input catalog, the more accurate the model becomes. ★★★

Earthquake Energy Field Predictor (Depth-Aware Global Model)

This project contains two complementary seismic-analysis systems:

shake.py — surface-level stress & hotspot predictor (0–30 days ahead)

deep-shake.py — deep-structure energy inversion model for identifying long-term high-magnitude candidates and possible super-events.

Neither program performs deterministic “earthquake prediction”.
They calculate stress migration, energy accumulation, and likely activation zones using physics-based kernels and inversion.

⚠ Important Notes About Predictive Uncertainty

The model produces uncontrolled timing uncertainty of 0–72 hours for near-surface activation.

This means:

If the map shows a hotspot for “tomorrow”, the actual event may occur
any time between now and +72 hours.

This applies only to surface-level predictions in shake.py.
deep-shake.py does not give exact times — only long-term structural candidates.

What Each Program Does
✔ shake.py — Surface / Crustal Earthquake Stress Model

Produces a depth-aware global stress map with:

direct kernel energy

inversion reconstruction

b-value plasticity estimation

day-ahead time-decay evolution (0–30 days)

energy halos (radius ∝ log(E))

3D interactive globe visualization

toggle layers (USGS, direct, inversion)

hotspot emergence tracking

This script is ideal for:

short-term activation analysis

crustal stress estimation

brittle-zone identification

visualizing earthquake clustering

studying stress propagation over days to weeks

✔ deep-shake.py — Deep Earth Structure & Super-Event Candidate Model

This script implements:

long-window energy ingestion (60–180+ days)

depth-filtered stress field reconstruction

Tikhonov inversion tuned for deep structure

clustering of high-energy deep cells

candidate identification for possible M8+ / M9+ long-term events

each candidate marked with a time window, not an exact date

possible multiple exit-points of the same deep source (same color group)

This system is not for short-term prediction.
It identifies:

extremely slow energy accumulation

mantle-level stress anomalies

deep drivers that may eventually produce megaquakes

candidate regions decades ahead

It is intentionally conservative and may show 0 or very few candidates.

⚠ Important Requirements for Correct Operation
✔ Use 60+ days of historical data

Accuracy becomes meaningful only when using at least 60–120 days of past earthquakes.

Short windows (1–7 days) show only surface noise.

Long windows reveal:

deeper accumulation patterns

multi-week energy transfer

slow migration processes

hidden fault loading

✔ Do not analyze earthquakes deeper than 100 km

Deep events (>100 km):

do not effectively transfer stress to the crust

cause false hotspot formation

produce unrealistic inversion artifacts

“light up” mantle features that never reach the surface

Recommended depth filter:
depth ≤ 100 km

✔ Grid resolution impacts performance
Grid	Resolution	Performance	Use case
Low	40×20	very fast, coarse	rough testing
Medium	60×40	best balance	recommended
High	100×80+	extremely slow	research only

Going beyond 120×90 may freeze weaker machines.
