==ATTENTION IMPORTANT.== 
During the download process, errors may appear that are not related to the program, but rather to the website's response. 
In this case, the program will simply display several errors in a row and then continue downloading, which will take about 20 minutes. 
However, there may or may not be any errors, depending on the website's response.

               🔴 CRITICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN shake.py AND deep-shake.py
               ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚡ shake.py — Short-Term Surface Stress Model (0–30 days ahead)
--------------------------------------------------------------
• Shows activation zones that appear **60–100 days before real events**
• The number of days loaded directly affects the accuracy
• Tracks **crustal stress**, **energy halos**, **plasticity**, and **migration**
• These parameters affect the efficiency and set the optimal grid choice for performance. NX = 80 NY = 80                  
• In the program, you will see a globe with marked points. 
• At the bottom of the screen there will be a slider where 0 is the current day and 1 is the next day, and so on, to view the evolution of the outbreak.
 

• By hovering over the event point you will see its parameter "b"
• If it is between 0.1 and 0.3, the area is very dangerous and the predicted magnitude may be higher.
• If it is between 0.3 and 0.5, then the danger is moderate; there is a slight chance of increasing the magnitude.
• If it is between 0.5 and 0.7, the predicted magnitude is correct.
• If it is between 0.7 and 0.9, the event is of little significance and the magnitude will be 0.7-1.5 points less.
• If it is between 0.9 and 2, then the event does not pose a threat in principle (light tremors)
• If the zone is above 2, it is not seismically dangerous at all and surface tremors are excluded, activity is only at the bottom
• An earthquake in water is usually about 0.9 points lower (water smooths it out)

🔵 deep-shake.py — Deep-Structure + Super-Event Candidate Model
---------------------------------------------------------------
This model requires the **full available earthquake catalog**, including:

• microquakes 1.0–2.0  
• moderate events  
• major events 6–8+  
• full long-window sequences (60–180 days).  A couple of decades from 1.1 is recommended

deep-shake.py reconstructs **deep, slow energy structures** and identifies:

• long-term high-magnitude candidates  
• M8+ / M9– class “super-event” precursors  
• multi-exit fault systems (same candidate → multiple possible surface points)  
• decade-scale mantle-driven anomalies, not short-term prediction  

🟦 IMPORTANT:
deep-shake.py does **NOT** predict exact dates.  
It shows *structural inevitability*, not timing.

★★★ The deeper the input catalog, the more accurate the model becomes. ★★★
